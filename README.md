# Bookdemo

Utilising the OpenLibrary API, please produce a simple book search engine that
shows the top 10 book results for a given search term.
• Please create a landing page where you can input the search term i.e. “Lord of the rings”.
• On clicking an OK button, the app will show the top 10 books (title, cover, author, year etc.) for that
search.
• We will leave the UI design of the app to the applicant but keep it simple as we do not expect our
developers to be graphic designers too.
• We expect to see some examples of error handling and input validation.
• We would like the UI to be written with UIKit.
The OpenLibrary API documentation can be found here.

What we’d love to see:
• Repository with feature branches and detailed commits.
• Clear and logical approach to how the project is structured.
• Explanatory comments.
Optional:
• Store the API output in a local sqlite database
• For the searches, search the local database first and then
hit the API in case of no result
